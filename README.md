# MyCalculator

This calculator was created as an exercise for the swing layouts and some
some basic data structures, such as binary trees.<br>
<br>
The calculator itself makes sure that the expression which is entered by
the user is a mathematically correct expression. Then a binary tree is 
created for that expression. This binary tree can then be traversed to
produce a result (of type double).<br>
